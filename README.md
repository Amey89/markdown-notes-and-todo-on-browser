markdown notes and todo without sync on your any browser 

hi all there is a .html file that you run on you any browser (tested on :chrome canary) and any device doesn't matter just keep html file in your device anytime you want to take notes open that in browser and write it .
and all data stored is in your browser so DON'T CLEAR BROWSER DATA WITHOUT EXPORTING YOUR TODO AND NOTES LETER YOU CAN IMPORT THEM.
I will make some some of app or add to Home screen shortcut in browser but for now it works.
later on I am planning to add google drive sync also i tried to do that but it was not working so anyone like experienced developer can fork or edit or whatever can add google drive sync for all that will be appreciated.
IMPORTANT : I USED AI A LOT (CHATGPT AMD DEEPSEEK) BECAUSE I AM LEARNING AND ITS NOT WHAT I DO I AM MECHANICAL ENGINEER AMD I WANTED TO HAVE A APP LIKETHIS SO HERE IT IS
